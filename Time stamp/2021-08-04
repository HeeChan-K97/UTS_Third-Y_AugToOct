Latent Heat: The amount of energy absorbed or released during a phase-change process.

Latent heat of fusion: The amount of energy absorbed during melting. It is equivalent to the amount
                       of energy released during freezing.
                       
Latent heat of vaporization: The amount of energy absorbed during vaporization and it is equivalent to the
                             energy released during condensation.
                             
The magnitudes of the latent heats depend on the temperature or pressure at which the phase change occurs.

At 1 atm pressure, the latent heat of fusion of water is 334 kJ/kg and the latent heat of vaporization is 2257 kJ/kg.

The atmospheric pressure, and thus the boiling temperature of water, decrease with elevation.

Critical Point: The point at which the saturated liquid and saturated vapor states are identical.
Triple Point: The point at which the liquid, solid, and vapor phases can exist together. On P-v or T-v
              diagrams, these triple-phase states form a line called triple line.
