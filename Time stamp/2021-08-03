Planar rigid body motion: General Plane Motion

1. Absolute Motion Analysis
2. Relative Motion Analysis
3. Instantaneous Centre(IC) of zero velocity

AMA:undergoes general plane motion.
  rolls without slipping == the displacement of a centre of a circle travelled is equal to the length of arc rolled.
  ** this is applicable only for cylinderical object or a circle
