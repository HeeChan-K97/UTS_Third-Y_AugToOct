Mechanics Of Solid

Stress: the intensity of a force acting over a finite cross-sectional area is the stress generated by that force
        Stress = pressure/cross-sectional area
        
1. Normal(axial) Stress: stress with direction normal to the plane
    i) Tensile stress
    ii) Compressive stress
    
Assumptions
* Structural element remains straight before and after load is applied
* Structural element has a constant cross-sectional area which remains flat or plane during deformation
* The material is homogeneous i.e. every point of the structurla element has the same material properties
* The load P acts along centroidal axis of the cross section

2. Shear Stress: intensity of force, or force per unit area, acting tangent to change in area
    (tau)      : the stress component that acts in the plane of the sectioned area
