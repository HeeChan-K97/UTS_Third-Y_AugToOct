Heat is the energy that travels between two objects due to their temperature
difference.
Work is the energy that causes displacement.

In Thermodynamics, Heat is known as low grade energy while work is known
as high grade energy.
Fact:
Work can be completely converted to Heat, however, Heat can’t be completely
converted to work

Open System is a system in which both energy and matter can
be exchanged with its surroundings.
Closed System: Energy can be exchanged with its surrounding,
but matter can’t be.
Isolated System: cannot exchange either matter or energy with
its surroundings.

Quasi-equilibrium process:
A process during which the system remains nearly in equilibrium at all times.

The net work done during a cycle is the difference between the work done by the system and the work done on the system.
