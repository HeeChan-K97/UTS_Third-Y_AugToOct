QuantumScape is a company located in the US that does research about batteries for electric cars.
Conventional lithium-ion battery consists of three layers which are cathode, anode and polymer separator 
keeping the electrodes apart and finally two electrical contacts at the top and bottom. When the conventional 
battery is being charged lithium-ion travels through the separator to the anode and carbon atoms in the anode 
hosts the lithium ion until it is needed. Solid-state lithium-metal has only two main layers which are cathode 
and a solid-state ceramic separator. As soon as it charges the lithium leaves the cathode through the ceramic 
separator and deposits between anode electrical contact and the separator forming a pure metallic lithium. 
This metallic lithium allows the energy of the solid-state battery to be stored in a smaller volume enabling 
higher density compared to the conventional lithium-ion battery.

Advantages of solid-state lithium metal:
•	Greater range from higher energy density
•	Faster charging rate, 15-minute fast charge
•	Safe operation
