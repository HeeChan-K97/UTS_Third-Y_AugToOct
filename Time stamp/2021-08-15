Setting Design Goals and objectives
(Invention of a self chilling soda can)
* Get the soda as cold as possible in the shortest possible time.
* Keep the container design simple.
* Keep the size and weight of the newely designed container similar to that of the traditional soda can.
* Keep the production costs low.
* Make the product environmentally safe.

** Unlike engineering design outcomes, the conclusiosns reached through economic evaluation are not necessarily time invariant.
   Economic decisions have to be based on the best information available at the time of the decision an a thorough understanding of the
   uncertainties in the forecasted data.
   
** An inaccurate estimate of asset needs canhave serious consequences. If you invest too much in assets, you incur unnecessarily heavy expenses.
   Spending too little on fixed assets is also harmful, because your firm.s equipment may be too obsolete to make products competitively; 
   without an adequate capacity, you may lose a portion of your market share to rival firms. Regaining lost customers involves heavy
   marketing expenses and may even require price reductions or product improvements, both of which are costly.
