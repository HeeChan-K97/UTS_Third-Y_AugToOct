the financial analyses of the project compare benefits and costs to the enterprise, 
while the economic analyses compare the benefits and costs to the whole economy

While financial analysis uses market prices to check the balance of investment and the sustainability of project, 
economic analysis uses economic price that is converted from the market price by excluding tax, profit, subsidy, etc. 
to measure the legitimacy of using national resources to certain project. 

Financial and economic analyses also differ in their treatment of external effects (benefits and costs), such as favorable effects on health.
